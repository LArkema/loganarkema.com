<p>This is a blog where I may occasionally jot down thoughts, if only to get them out of my head.
  All thoughts and opinions expressed are my own, and not necessarily those of my employer.
  I do not intend to frequently reference work I conducted at my job, but if I do it will be to summarize or advertise
  the product, not to editorialize about it.
</p>
