## Privacy Policy

The privacy of my visitors is extremely important. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected and how it is used.

To the best of my ability, _I_ do not collect, track, or store **any** information about who visits my site. That said, this site was generated using a template, and I have not (yet) thoroughly reviewed each code file included in the template to ensure it does not contain any third party trackers. 

However, I use [privacy badger](https://privacybadger.org/) to detect and block such trackers, and recommend most people do the same. I initially detected two trackers embedded in the template (for Google Analytics and Cloudflare), both of which I have disabled. If you detect any additional privacy-related concerns on this site, please let me know (via a GitHub issue or Twitter DM).

### GitHub Hosting
This site is hosted on GitHub pages. As result, GitHub (owned by Microsoft) can view, and likely logs, information about your traffic to this site. This information generally includes:

* Internet Protocol addresses (IP)
* Types of browser
* Internet Service Provider (ISP)
* Date and time stamp
* Referring and exit pages
* Number of clicks

I have found [GitHub's privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages), where it sparsely mentions that they may collect information, including IP addresses, from you.

If you want to further protect your anonymity while using this site, I recommend using a VPN or the [TOR browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/). As a reminder, these services may obfuscate your IP address, but your privacy also, at least in part, depends on your VPN's logging practices and/or your TOR traffic blending in with other users (which should not be a concern for this site).

I am not entirely satisfied with this arrangement for multiple reasons, but GitHub will host this site for free and right now it's not worth it for me to pay to host this. I may look into paying to host this somewhere with stronger privacy guarantees if this site generates enough traffic / interest.

### Cookies and Web Beacons
While I make my best effort to remove trackers from this site, third-party advertisers may also place and read cookies on your browser and/or use web beacons to collect information. This site has no access or control over these cookies. You should review the respective privacy policies on any and all third-party ad servers for more information regarding their practices and how to opt-out.

If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your web browser options. Instructions for doing so can be found on the specific web browsers' websites.
